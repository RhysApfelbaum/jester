...
Jester: Hello, sir knight! You look very brave and noble in your armor.
Knight: Oh! Hi there you. Well of course I do!
Jester: Did you fight alongside the king in his last battle?
Knight: I did, indeed. I was his loyal and faitful servant. I would have died for him, if he hadn't died first.
Jester: Oh, how tragic... How did he die exactly?
Knight: He was stabbed in the back by a traitor. A cowardly and dishonorable act.
Jester: I see. And who was this traitor? Do you happen to know his name?
Knight: I do. It was me.
Jester: Oh! Isn't that wonderful! Well have a fun day would you.
